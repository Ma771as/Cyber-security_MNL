"1","A human resources department deploys a generative AI (gen AI) model to screen job applications and provide a shortlist of candidates to recruiters. Recruiters notice that some seemingly qualified candidates are consistently being overlooked, but the AI provides no explanation for its rankings or exclusions. The company needs to address this lack of transparency. What should they do?","Collect a larger and more diverse dataset for the gen AI model.","Fine-tune the gen AI model.","Implement explainable gen AI policies.","Develop fairness assessments for the gen AI model.","C","A is incorrect because, while a larger and more diverse dataset could potentially improve the model's accuracy and reduce bias, it does not inherently make the model's screening process transparent. Recruiters would still lack insight into why certain candidates are being shortlisted over others. While data quality is essential for ethical AI, it doesn't automatically provide explainability. [4]","B is incorrect because fine-tuning aims to optimize the model's performance on the screening task, but it doesn't necessarily reveal how the model is making its choices. Even if the shortlist improves after fine-tuning, the lack of transparency regarding the selection criteria remains. Fine-tuning focuses on improving task-specific performance, not on making the model's reasoning understandable. [4]","C is correct because it directly tackles the issue of unclear decision-making. Implementing explainable gen AI techniques would allow the HR department and recruiters to understand the factors that the AI model is using to rank and exclude candidates. This aligns with the principle that transparency is paramount for ethical applications and that users need to understand how AI systems make decisions. Explainable AI makes the decision-making processes of AI models transparent and understandable, which is crucial for building trust and identifying potential issues. [4, 5]","D is incorrect because, while developing fairness assessments is important for ensuring the AI model is not discriminatory in its candidate selection, it does not directly address the need to understand why the model is making specific decisions. Assessing for fairness helps identify potential biases, but it doesn't explain the reasoning behind individual candidate rankings or exclusions. [5]"
"2","A company is evaluating the use of large language models (LLMs) to enhance its operations and customer interactions. What is a primary characteristic of LLMs?*","LLMs excel in highly specific technical tasks requiring deep, singular domain expertise.","LLMs learn and generalize effectively from small datasets for niche applications.","LLMs have strong inherent logical reasoning and problem-solving abilities without extra prompting.","LLMs are trained on vast datasets, enabling broad language and context understanding, and adaptability across many tasks.","D","A is incorrect because, while LLMs can be applied to specific tasks, their core strength lies in their general language understanding derived from broad training, enabling them to handle a variety of applications rather than being limited to highly specialized areas. [6]","B is incorrect because LLMs are known for requiring vast amounts of data for effective training to achieve their broad capabilities. They are not typically effective with limited datasets without fine-tuning on more specific data. [6]","C is incorrect because, while LLMs can exhibit reasoning capabilities, this often requires effective prompt engineering or advanced techniques like chain-of-thought prompting. They do not inherently possess strong logical reasoning without guidance. Additionally, limitations such as ""hallucinations,"" indicate they are not flawless problem-solvers. [6]","D is correct because foundation models, including LLMs, are trained on massive amounts of diverse data (text, images, and code). This broad training allows them to develop a deep understanding of the data and be adapted to many different tasks. The flexibility of foundation models, including LLMs, to support a wide range of use cases stems directly from this training on diverse data. [7, 8]"
"3","An AI robot learns optimal package delivery routes in a city. It receives positive scores for fast, successful deliveries and negative scores for delays or failures. Through this feedback, the robot improves its navigation over time. What type of machine learning is being used to train the robot?*","Supervised learning","Deep learning","Unsupervised learning","Reinforcement learning","D","A is incorrect because supervised learning requires labeled data, where each input is paired with a correct output. This scenario does not involve pre-labeled optimal routes; the robot learns through trial and error. [9]","B is incorrect because, while deep learning can be a component of reinforcement learning, it is not the overarching learning paradigm described. Deep learning refers to neural networks with multiple layers. The learning process itself is defined by the reward and penalty mechanism. [9, 10]","C is incorrect because unsupervised learning focuses on finding patterns in unlabeled data without specific goals or feedback. The robot's learning is goal-oriented (optimizing delivery routes) and driven by the feedback it receives. [9, 11]","D is correct because the robot learns through interaction with its environment and by receiving rewards (positive scores) and penalties (negative scores) for its actions. That is the fundamental process of reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning is all about learning through interaction and feedback, where an algorithm learns to maximize rewards and minimize penalties by interacting with its environment. [9, 11, 12]"
"4","A company wants to use generative AI (gen AI) to automate complex workflows and improve decision-making across its various departments. They are considering implementing AI agents as a key component of their strategy. What is the primary function of an AI agent in a gen AI system?*","To provide the computing power for training and running advanced AI models.","To be the user interface for interacting with AI models.","To be a smart system that can analyze, use tools, and make decisions to reach goals.","To be a central storage place for the data that AI models use.","C","A is incorrect because, while infrastructure is crucial for AI, its primary function is to provide the foundational computing resources, not to act as the intelligent decision-making component of an agent. [13]","B is incorrect because, while platforms like Vertex AI Studio offer interfaces for interacting with models, the primary function of an agent is the autonomous reasoning and action, not just the user interface. Agents use models, but they are more than just an interface. [13]","C is correct because AI agents are defined as entities that observe, act, and achieve goals by incorporating a reasoning loop and tools. A gen AI agent is an application that tries to achieve a goal by observing the world and acting upon it using the tools it has at its disposal. [13, 14]","D is incorrect because, while data storage is essential for AI, it is a separate function from the agent's ability to process information, reason, and take actions. Agents utilize data stores as tools, but their core function is not data management itself. [13]"
"5","An advertising agency needs to quickly generate many photorealistic images from text for client campaigns because traditional photoshoots are slow and costly.

This openness implies support for customer choice across different offerings. This directly mitigates concerns about vendor lock-in and promotes flexibility in their technology stack. [17, 18]","B is incorrect because a strict adherence to proprietary technologies would exacerbate concerns about vendor lock-in, directly contradicting the company's priority for flexibility. [17]","C is incorrect because, while fully managed services offer convenience, they can potentially limit user control and choice. This would not align with the company's desire for flexibility and avoiding vendor lock-in. [17]","D is incorrect because, while automation can streamline workflows, it doesn't inherently address the concern of vendor lock-in. The company's priority is maintaining flexibility and choice among different AI technologies. [17]"
"7","A consulting research team needs to analyze multiple lengthy reports and documents to find key trends and make client recommendations. They require a method to quickly understand each document's core findings, link information across sources, and efficiently organize insights for their report. Manual methods are too slow and complex. Which Google Cloud offering should they use?*","NotebookLM","Gemini app","Vertex AI Search","Gemini for Google Workspace","A","A is correct because NotebookLM is specifically designed as an AI-first notebook grounded in user-provided documents to help users gain insights faster. It allows users to upload multiple documents, ask questions about the content, request summaries, and save key insights as notes. [19, 20]","B is incorrect. The Gemini app is Google’s generative AI chatbot that can help with writing, planning, learning, and more. However, it is not specifically designed for the in-depth analysis and organization of insights from a specific set of uploaded research documents in the way NotebookLM is. [2, 19]","C is incorrect because Vertex AI Search is designed for building search applications over structured and unstructured data. While it can help find information within documents, it does not offer the focused Q&A, summarization, and note-taking capabilities of NotebookLM for a specific research task. [19]","D is incorrect because Gemini for Google Workspace integrates generative AI into productivity tools like Docs and Drive. While helpful for individual document-level tasks, it does not provide the dedicated, multi-document analysis and insight organization features of NotebookLM for a research project involving multiple complex documents. [2, 19]"
"8","A grocery store chain has data in several internal systems like sales, inventory, and marketing. Employees waste time searching these systems for information on product performance, stock, and campaign effectiveness. They need a central way to easily access and understand data across these systems for better decisions and efficiency. Which Google Cloud offering should they use?*","Gemini for Google Workspace","Google Agentspace","Vertex AI Search","Conversational Agents","B","A is incorrect because Gemini for Google Workspace integrates generative AI features into productivity tools like Gmail, Docs, and Sheets to enhance individual and collaborative work within those applications. [21]","B is correct because Google Agentspace is designed to help teams use their company's information more effectively by creating customized agents that can access and understand data from various sources, regardless of where that data is stored.

"9","A tech company has separate teams using different tools for their machine learning projects, causing duplicated work and scaling issues. They need a central platform to manage all their AI development, deployment, and monitoring efficiently. Which Google Cloud offering should they use?*","Cloud Functions","Vertex AI","Google Agentspace","BigQuery","B","A is incorrect because Cloud Functions is a serverless execution environment for running event-driven code. It does not provide a central platform to manage the entire machine learning lifecycle across teams. [24]","B is correct because Vertex AI is Google Cloud's unified ML platform designed to streamline the entire ML workflow. Vertex AI offers the infrastructure, tools, and pre-trained models needed for the centralized building, deployment, and management of ML and generative AI solutions. [3, 25]","C is incorrect because Google Agentspace is designed to help teams use their company's information more effectively by creating customized AI agents for information access and task automation, not for end-to-end ML project management. [22, 25]","D is incorrect because BigQuery is a fully managed and serverless data warehouse. It is crucial for storing and analyzing large datasets used in machine learning, but it doesn't offer the comprehensive platform for managing the complete ML development, deployment, and monitoring process that Vertex AI does. [2, 25]"
"10","A software company's AI chatbot struggles to answer customer questions about recently released features because this information is not in its original training data. Customers are getting inaccurate answers, increasing support agent workload. The company wants the chatbot to use the latest product documentation to give accurate, up-to-date responses without retraining the entire model. Which technique should they use?*","Fine-tuning","Prompt engineering","Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)","Human-in-the-loop (HITL)","C","A is incorrect because fine-tuning requires retraining the model on new data, which is more time-consuming than immediately accessing existing documentation with RAG. [26]","B is incorrect because prompt engineering alone cannot provide information the model doesn't already have in its training data. However, prompt engineering can be used within a RAG system. [8, 26]","C is correct because Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) allows the language model to retrieve relevant information from external sources (like the latest product documentation) and use it to generate more accurate and contextually appropriate responses, addressing the chatbot's knowledge gap without full retraining. [22, 26, 27]","D is incorrect because Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) involves human intervention and doesn't proactively enable the chatbot to answer questions about new information automatically as RAG does. [26]"
"11","A business analyst asks a generative AI model about the quarterly revenue of a small startup that recently entered the market. The model confidently provides a specific revenue figure and even mentions a supposed press release detailing the company's success. However, after further investigation, the analyst discovers that the startup has not yet released any financial reports, and no such press release exists. The information provided by the AI model is entirely fabricated despite sounding plausible. Which type of large language model limitation does this exemplify?*","Bias","Knowledge cutoff","Data dependency","Hallucinations","Hallucinations","A is incorrect because bias refers to the model's tendency to produce outputs that reflect imbalances or prejudices present in its training data, not necessarily the fabrication of entirely new information. [28]","B is incorrect because knowledge cutoff refers to the point in time after which the model has not been trained on new information. While this can lead to an inability to answer questions about recent events, in this scenario, the model is generating non-existent information rather than stating it doesn't know or providing outdated information. [28]","C is incorrect because data dependency highlights that the performance of foundation models relies heavily on the quality and completeness of their training data. While a lack of specific data might lead to an inability to answer, hallucinations involve generating factually incorrect or nonsensical responses. [28]","D is correct because hallucinations occur when foundation models produce outputs that are not accurate or based on real information. The AI model fabricates revenue data and a press release that does not exist, which is a clear example of a hallucination. [28]"
"12","A generative AI tool that answers employee policy questions is providing outdated and inaccurate information, causing confusion. The company wants the tool to give reliable answers based on the latest official documents. What should the organization do?*","Fine-tune the underlying language model with a broader dataset of general knowledge.","Increase the temperature setting of the language model.","Implement grounding techniques.","Reduce the token count parameter.","C","A is incorrect because fine-tuning with a broader general knowledge dataset would not necessarily ensure the AI adheres to the company's specific and latest internal policies. [29]","B is incorrect because increasing the temperature parameter would likely increase inaccurate responses. [29]","C is correct because grounding connects the AI's output to verifiable information sources, such as internal documents, improving accuracy and reliability. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a specific grounding method that retrieves relevant information before generating a response. [27, 29]","D is incorrect because reducing the token count only affects the length of the responses, not their accuracy. [29]"
